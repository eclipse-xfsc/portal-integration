            <br />
            eco gathers and automatically stores on its server log file information that your browser deposited with us
            while you were surfing.
            <br />
            In brief, here is the key data that we store:
            <br />
            • Type of browser/browser version
            <br />
            • The operating system used
            <br />
            • Referrer URL (the page visited previously)
            <br />
            • URLs / pages on this website that have been accessed
            <br />
            • IP address of the accessing device along with its name
            <br />
            • Time of the server request
            <br />
            • Visitor history
            <br />
            Furthermore, we record the complete Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Clickstream through and from our website,
            i.e., the sequence of the pages of our website that you visit, including date and time, cookie number, and
            the content that you viewed or for which you searched.
            <br />
            During your visits, we sometimes use JavaScript in order to gather and evaluate information, including the
            time it takes a website to load, download errors, the duration of the visit on a subpage, information
            regarding the interaction between pages (e.g., scrolling, clicking, mouse-overs) and leaving the page.

            The legal basis for the processing of the IP address is Article 6 ( 1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest
            results from the following list of purposes of the data processing. Please note on this point that it is not
            possible for us to draw any direct conclusions about your identity on the basis of the data collected, nor
            do we attempt to draw such conclusions.
            <br />
            The IP address of your device and the remaining data listed above is used by us for the following purposes:
            <br />

            The data is saved for a period of 7 days, after which it is automatically deleted or anonymised. Further, we
            make use of so-called cookies, tracking tools and social media plug-ins for our website. Exactly what
            process is undertaken and how your data is used for these is clarified in Section III.15. below.

            - Family name(s)
            <br />

          <p>
            The personal data imparted to us will be used exclusively for the purpose of processing your enquiry and
            will be deleted after processing your query. The legal basis for this is your consent within the meaning of
            Article 6 (1)(a) GDPR, as well as Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR. The proper processing of your enquiry is to be
            regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.{' '}
            <b>
              <em>
                You can withdraw your consent to the processing of the personal data imparted to us at any time with

            <b>3. Registration for events and online events</b>
            <br />
            Registration forms for eco’s numerous events are provided in advance on our website. In the scope of your
            registration, personal data will generally be collected. This includes:
            <br />
            - Family name(s)
            <br />
            - First name(s)
            <br />
            - Company
            <br />
            - Job title
            <br />
            - When necessary, billing and delivery address
            <br />
            - When necessary, billing and payment details
            <br />
            - Email address
            <br />
            - When necessary, phone number.
            <br />
            These details are collected for the purposes of identifying and registering you on the day of the event.
            <br />
            The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR, i.e. you make the data available to us on the basis of
            the contractual relationship between yourself and us. In addition, regarding the processing of your email
            address, the German Civil Code requires us by law to send an electronic order confirmation (Article 6 (1)(c)
            GDPR). Insofar as we do not use your contact details for marketing purposes (see Section III.6. below), we
            store your data collected for the fulfilment of the contract until the expiration of the legal or possible
            contractual warranty and guarantee rights. After expiry, we retain the information regarding the contractual
            relationship that is required by commercial law and tax law for the legally determined period. For this
            period of time (generally ten years from the conclusion of the contract), the data will only be re-processed
            in the case of an audit by the taxation authorities.
          </p>
          <p>We work with various service providers to improve the handling and implementation of our events:</p>
          <p>
            The Registration for our events takes place online either via the pretix ticket shop (rami.io GmbH,

            We use the Software GoToWebinar from LogMeIn Ireland Limited to carry out webinars. As part of the
            registration on the infrastructure of the company LogMeIn (10 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, D02R573 Ireland),
            personal data is collected. In particular, this includes the family name(s), first name, company, position
            and email address. The data protection regulations of LogMeIn can be found here:{' '}

            <br />
            We also use the networking platform talque, from Real Life Interaction GmbH (Choriner Str. 3, 10119 Berlin,
            Germany) to hold digital events or conferences. When you register for one of our events supported by talque,
            we pass on the data generated during registration to talque so that talque can send you a personal
            invitation link to the respective event network. Registration on the platform itself takes place on the
            talque infrastructure. talque’s data protection provisions can be found at{' '}

            <br />
            The processing of the data by the above-mentioned third-party providers takes place on the basis of Article
            26 or Article 28 GDPR. The data is processed within the legally permissible framework in Germany, the
            European Union, and the USA. For data processing in the USA, an appropriate level of protection has been
            established by agreeing to the EU standard contractual clauses. Our contract processors process the
            transferred personal data on our behalf in accordance with our specifications. As part of the implementation
            of events via the talque platform, we use the products of other service providers, e.g., for video
            streaming, live voting or connecting tools, depending on the design of the event. If we ourselves actively
            pass on the personal data of participants to these third parties, we do this exclusively within the
            framework of an order processing contract concluded with the providers in accordance with Article 28 GDPR.
            <br />
            eco ordinarily creates participant lists for events. The purpose of these is to inform the participants, and
            these lists are attached to the event documents. The lists usually include the family name(s), first
            name(s), and employer of each of the event’s attendees.

            <br />
            If you would like to become part of one of our eco talque communities, you can send a membership request to
            eco via eco.de. The following personal data will be collected and stored as part of your request:
          </p>
          <p>
            - Family name(s)
            <br />
            - First name(s)
            <br />
            - Email address
            <br />
            - Company
            <br />
            - Position (optional)
            <br />- Company address
          </p>
          <p>
            This data is required for the assessment of your membership request and, in the case of a positive decision,
            for the creation of your profile in the network you have chosen. The platform on which our community
            networks are located is operated by the company talque (see Section 3 for further details). Talque is our
            service provider and processes your personal data on our behalf. On admission to the network you have
            chosen, we will pass on the data you generated in the course of your membership application to talque so
            that talque can send you a personal invitation link to the corresponding community network. Registration on
            the platform itself takes place on the talque infrastructure. Talque’s data protection provisions can be
            found at https://web.talque.com/en/privacy-policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for the collection, storage and transfer of your personal data is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR.
            The processing of your data by talque is carried out on the basis of Article 26 GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of a decline of your membership request, your data will be deleted immediately. In the case of
            an admission to the network, your data will be stored by us for as long as the network remains in existence,
            unless you withdraw from the network at an earlier point in time. In this case, we will delete your data
            from that point in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>5. Association Membership</b>
            <br />
            Should you decide to become a member of the eco – Association of the Internet Industry or if you are already
            a member, we will process data that you provide to us via our application form, including personal data, for
            the purpose of fulfilling the rights and obligations resulting from the membership and specified in our
            Articles of Association and in the eco portfolio, for accounting purposes, and in order to be able to
            contact you. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)( b) GDPR.
            <br />
            In addition to our personnel, service providers commissioned by us may also receive data from us for the
            fulfilment of contractual or legal obligations, e.g., credit reporting agencies, sales partners, credit
            institutions, IT service providers.
            <br />
            The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was
            collected. In the case of a conclusion of a contract, this is usually the case upon termination of the
            contractual relationship, provided that there are no legal obligations to retain data. In this case, a
            longer retention period is required. This period can be up to 10 years. If data is to be retained to ensure
            the enforcement of legal claims, the limitation period can be up to 30 years, whereby the regular limitation
            period is three years.

            <b>6. Data processing for marketing purposes</b>
            <br />
            Insofar as you have concluded a contract with us regarding participation in an event, we will process your
            postal contact address without a concrete declaration of consent in order to occasionally provide you with
            news on the association or forthcoming events. We process your email address without a concrete declaration
            of consent in order to occasionally provide you with other, similar and for you interesting information
            about webinars, events or talks of eco or subsidiaries of eco. Beyond that, your data will not be used any
            further without your express consent.
            <br />
            The GDPR declares such data processing on the basis of Article 6 (1)(f) as conceivable in principle and to
            be a legitimate interest. The duration of data storage for marketing purposes does not follow any strict
            precepts and is oriented around the question of whether the storage is necessary for marketing purposes.

          <p>
            <b>
              <i>
                You can withdraw your consent to the data processing for the purposes set out above at any time, without
                incurring costs, for each channel independently, and with effect for the future. For this, an email or
                letter to the contact details listed in Section II suffices. There are no costs other than the
                transmission costs according to the basic tariffs.

            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Insofar as you withdraw consent, the affected contact addresses will be blocked for further
            marketing-related data processing. Please note that in exceptional cases, it is possible that further
            sending of marketing material may take place temporarily, even after receiving your withdrawal of consent.
            This is technically due to the necessary lead-in time for advertisements and does not mean that we will not
            comply with your objection. Thank you for your understanding.

            <br />
            <b>10.1 Certification</b>
            <br />
            If you have been certified as a sender with the Certified Senders Alliance (CSA), an eco service, we will
            collect and process various data from you, including personal data, that you provide to us via the CSA
            online form or other forms required for the certification process. We use this data in the context of the
            contract initiation, e.g., to assess whether you are eligible for CSA certification. When a contract is
            concluded, we use this data, for example, to fulfil the contract concluded between you and us, for
            accounting purposes, or in order to be able to contact you. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)(b)
            GDPR.
            <br />
            Within our company group, personnel who need the data to fulfil the contractual or legal obligations are
            given access to the data. In addition, service providers commissioned by us may also receive data from us
            for these purposes, e.g., credit reporting agencies, sales partners, credit institutions, IT service
            providers.
            <br />
            The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.
            In the case of a conclusion of a contract, this is usually the case upon termination of the contractual
            relationship, provided that there are no legal obligations to retain data. In this case, a longer retention
            period is required. This period can be up to 10 years. If data is to be retained to ensure the enforcement
            of legal claims, the limitation period can be up to 30 years, whereby the regular limitation period is three
            years.
          </p>

            <b>10.2 Use of the CSA Customer Portal (Certification Monitor)</b>
            <br />
            On our CSA website, customers can register for our CSA Customer Portal area by providing personal data. The
            data is entered into an input mask and transmitted to us. A transfer of data to third parties does not take
            place. The following data is collected during the registration process:
          </p>
          <p>
            - User name
            <br />
            - Family name(s)

            - First name(s)
            <br />
            - Customer number
            <br />
            - Email address
            <br />
            - Password
            <br />
            - Telephone number

            - Language
            <br />- IP address and host name
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR, i.e., you make the data available to us on the basis of
            the contractual relationship between customers and the CSA.
            <br />
            Registration is required for ordering and provision of CSA services through the CSA Customer Portal.
            <br />
            The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. This is the
            case when the data for the implementation of the contract are no longer required. Even after the conclusion
            of the contract, there may be a need to store the personal data of the contracting party in order to comply
            with contractual or legal obligations. After expiry, we retain the information regarding the contractual
            relationship that is required by commercial law and tax law for the legally determined period. For this
            period of time (generally ten years from the conclusion of the contract), the data will only be re-processed
            in the case of an audit by the taxation authorities.

            these plug-ins takes place through the so-called Shariff method in order to protect visitors to our website
            in the best way possible. In order to best protect visitors to our website, our integration of these
            plug-ins is achieved using the “Shariff” method. At the point of loading a website on which they are
            integrated, the buttons offered directly by social network operators are already transmitting personal data
            such as your IP address or entire cookies without permission and thus pass on precise details of your
            surfing behaviour to the social providers without any request. For this to happen, you do not need to be
            logged in or be a member of the respective network. A Shariff button, on the other hand, only establishes
            direct contact between the social network and the visitor when the latter actively clicks on the Share
            button. Shariff thereby prevents you from leaving a digital track on every page you visit and improves data
            protection. By using Shariff, we can protect your personal data and still integrate buttons for social
            sharing. Further information on Shariff can be found on the website of the provider, Heise Medien GmbH &amp;

            <b>13.4.1. Facebook</b>
            <br />
            On our website, we use plug-ins for the social network Facebook that are offered by Facebook Inc. The
            Facebook plug-ins are denoted through a Facebook logo or with the addition “Like” or “Share”. An overview of
            the Facebook plug-ins and their appearance can be found at{' '}
            <a href='src/components/static/PrivacyPage?locale=en_EN'>
              https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=en_EN
            </a>
            <br />
            When you activate such a plug-in (first click), your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook
            servers. The content of the plug-in is directly transmitted to your browser and is integrated into the page.
            Through this integration, Facebook obtains the information that your browser has accessed the specific page
            of our web presence, even if you do not possess a Facebook profile or are not currently logged in at
            Facebook. This information (including the IP address) is transferred directly from your browser to a
            Facebook server in the USA and is stored there. If you are logged in at Facebook, Facebook can directly
            relate the visit to our website with your Facebook profile. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example,
            by pressing the “Like” button, this information is also directly transmitted to and stored in a Facebook
            server. The information will also be published on your Facebook profile and shown to your Facebook friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose and the extent of data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as
            well as your rights and possible settings for the protection of your privacy, can be found in Facebook’s
            data protection information at <a href='https://facebook.com/policy.php'>https://facebook.com/policy.php</a>

            your Facebook profile, you need to log out of Facebook before visiting our website. You can also completely
            prevent the loading of the Facebook plug-ins using add-ons for your browser, e.g. with the “Facebook
            Blocker” or with the Facebook Container Add-On (for Firefox).

            “Tweet”. When you activate such a plug-in by clicking on it, a direct connection is established between your

            <br />
            <b>1. Overview</b>
            <br />
            Alongside the right to withdraw the consent given to us, you also have the following rights when the
            respective legal conditions are extant:
            <br />• <b>Right of information</b> regarding your personal data stored by us in accordance with Article 15
            GDPR; in particular, you can obtain information about the purpose of processing, the category of personal
            data, the category of recipient for whom your data is or has been made available, the planned period of
            retention, the origin of your data, insofar as it was not collected directly from you,
            <br />• <b>Right of rectification</b> of erroneous or to completion of correct data in accordance with
            Article 16 GDPR,
            <br />• <b>Right to deletion</b> of your data stored by us in accordance with Article 17 GDPR, insofar as
            there are no legal or contractual requirements to retain the data or other legal obligations or rights to
            the continued retention of the data,
            <br />• <b>Right to limit</b> the processing of your data in accordance with Article 18 GDPR, insofar as you
            dispute the correctness of the data, the processing is illegal, but you oppose the deletion of said data;
            the data controller no longer requires the data, but you require said data for the assertion, exercise or
            defence of legal claims, or you have filed an objection to the processing in accordance with Article 21
            GDPR,
            <br />• <b>Right to data portability</b> in accordance with Article 20 GDPR, i.e. the right to receive
            selected data about you stored by us in a standard, machine-readable format, or to have this transmitted to
            another data controller,
            <br />• <b>Right to complain to a supervisory authority</b>. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory
            authority of your normal place of residence or work, or of our association headquarters to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Right to object</b>
            <br />
            <b>
              <em>
                Under the conditions of Article 21 (1) GDPR, the data processing can be objected to on grounds arising
                out of the special situation of the person affected.
              </em>
            </b>
            <br />
            The above general right to object applies for all purposes of processing described in this Privacy Policy
            that are processed on the basis of Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR. In contrast to the special right to object to data
            processing for marketing purposes (see Section III.5.2. above), we are, according to the GDPR, only
            obligated to implement such a general right to object if you can provide grounds of superordinate importance
            (e.g. a possible risk to life or health).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>V. Forwarding to third parties</b>
            <br />
            The data collected by us is not sold. We share the information that we obtain to third parties exclusively
            to the extent described in the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1. Affiliated companies</b>
            <br />
            Affiliated companies that are under the control of eco, if they are either subject to this Privacy Policy or
            adhere to guidelines that offer at least as much protection as this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Service providers</b>
            <br />
            We commission other companies and individuals to fulfil tasks for us. Examples include supporting with the
            organisation of events (e.g. competence groups, congresses, or LocalTalks), the sending of letters or
            emails, the maintenance of our contact lists, the analysis of our databases, marketing measures (including
            the making available of search results and links), and the handling of payments (credit cards, bank
            transfers, and purchase order invoicing). These service providers have access to personal information that
            is necessary for fulfilling their tasks. However, they are not permitted to use this for other purposes. In
            addition to this, they are obligated to handle the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
            applicable data protection laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3. Protection of eco and third parties</b>
            <br />
            We disclose personal data when we are legally obliged to do so or when such disclosure is necessary to
            protect our rights and those of third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4. Recipients outside of the EU</b>
            <br />
            Your data will generally be processed in Germany and in other European countries. If, in exceptional cases,
            your data is also processed in countries outside the European Union (i.e. in so-called third countries),
            this is done insofar as you have expressly consented to this or it is necessary for our provision of
            services to you, or it is provided for by law (Article 49 GDPR). Furthermore, your data will only be
            processed in third countries if certain measures ensure that an adequate level of data protection exists
            (e.g. adequacy decision of the EU Commission; EU standard contractual clauses or so-called suitable
            guarantees, Article 44ff. of the GDPR).
          </p>
          <p>

            <br />
